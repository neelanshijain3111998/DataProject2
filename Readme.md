# Data Project 2: Company Master
In this project, I build a simple command-line application that reads Data from Database. I perform some SQL Commands and print out the results in table format.

Here are the steps to download the project and run the program in visual studio 2019.
>- Create a `new folder` on your computer where you want to download this project. Then open `git bash Here` and run this command 
  `git clone git@github.com:neelanshijain3111998/DataProject2.git .`
>- Then, you will get all the files in your folder. Open the `Project2.csproj` file in visual studio 2019 from this folder.
>
>- Go to view -> Solution Explorer -> Select project->Right click-> Properties->Debug Tab->Command line argument-> provide `load` first-> then run program-> Again provide `analyzer`->
  ->then run the program.
>- On the console window, you will see like this
